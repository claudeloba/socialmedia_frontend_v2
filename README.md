The final assignment for Backend 2 was to create a social media app.
Something I have previously built a couple of times.
Therefore, to challenge myself this time, I decided to try and revisit and old project I barely have any recollection of, and refactor and add features to the old project to meet the new criteria. One of them being migrating from a MySQL to a MongoDB-database.
[Old Codebase](https://github.com/claudeloba/Social-Media-App).

This is the first time I actually revisit an old project I barely remember.
I feel this will be more authentic to real-life work experience, where focus will lie on maintainance rather than having the luxury of starting from scratch each time with out-of-the-box functional npm package versions and freedom to do whatever you would like.

I expect to meet a lot of bugs and broken code along the way, and hopefully this will make me a better developer and improve my debugging skills.

I will start with writing the tests and implement a TDD-approach to my code to hopefully have a functional app at the end of it.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
